The Consumer Price Index (CPI) represents changes in prices as experienced by Canadian consumers

It is obtained by comparing, over time, the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by consumers. The CPI is widely used as an indicator of the change in the general level of consumer prices or the rate of inflation. Since the purchasing power of money is affected by changes in prices, the CPI is useful to virtually all Canadians.
